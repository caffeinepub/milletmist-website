REQ-84 adds the new image with unique versioned filename, REQ-85 uses the unique filename 'barnali-ceo-v34.dim_400x400.png', REQ-86 implements triple-layer cache-busting with timestamp query parameters and cache-control attributes, and REQ-87 adds unique React key props based on build timestamp. All acceptance criteria appear to be met in the code changes.",
