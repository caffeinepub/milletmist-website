  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses both requirements. REQ-61 is fulfilled by adding a backend method to retrieve the canister ID and a frontend hook to query it. REQ-62 is fulfilled by creating a comprehensive DNS configuration guide component that displays the canister URL, provides Cloudflare-specific CNAME setup instructions, SSL/TLS configuration guidance, and DNS propagation information. All acceptance criteria are met with appropriate UI components, error handling, and user-friendly instructions.",
