The Hero.tsx component demonstrates significantly darker borders (border-[3px] with full opacity primary/secondary/accent colors) and increased background opacity (bg-primary/40, bg-secondary/40, bg-accent/40, up from previous lighter values) for all three feature pills ('100% Natural Millets', 'Women-Led', 'Farmer Support'). The styling is consistent across all three pills and applies to both mobile and desktop viewports using responsive Tailwind classes.",
