  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 and REQ-2 completely: Barnali Chakraborty's image was replaced with the new professional headshot (barnali-founder.dim_400x400.png) and aggressive cache-busting was implemented using timestamp query parameters, DOM manipulation via useEffect, and unique React keys. However, REQ-3 (deployment to draft environment first) is not evidenced in the code changes, which only show source code modifications without deployment artifacts or environment-specific configurations.",

      "reason": "No evidence of draft environment deployment in the diff. The changes show only source code modifications to frontend/src/components/CoreTeam.tsx and backend/main.mo, but no deployment configurations, environment-specific settings, or deployment artifacts that would indicate draft environment deployment has occurred.",
