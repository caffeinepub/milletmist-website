  "summary": "The diff successfully implements both REQ-8 and REQ-9. A new CoreTeam.tsx component was created with team member profiles, integrated into App.tsx, and the navigation menu was updated with a 'Team' link. The component uses the existing design system with warm earth tones and follows the established component structure. Team member images are loaded from the correct assets/generated directory with fallback handling implemented.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly lists 'Interactive features like team member detail modals or filtering' as non-goals, and social media integration was not requested in any requirement or acceptance criteria",
